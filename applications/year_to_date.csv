The neighbour and her entourage of friends and family allow their children to play football on my path and use my garage doors as goalposts; they have caused damage to my vehicle and visiting friends vehicles by throwing stones and riding bicycles on my drive. When confronted they hurl a barrage of abuse and spit on my door, all this happens whilst I am away at work and cannot influence the situation positively. The landlord has been informed of the decaying situation however as they live in Australia they have not been much influence. As a result the police have been called on a number of occasions and have advised that we install CCTV and erect a fence within our boundaries and not to encroach on the border area.

The remaining tree in my garden has got considerably larger in the 20 years that I have lived in my house.
