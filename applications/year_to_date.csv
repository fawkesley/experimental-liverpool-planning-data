The reason I ask for permission is because I have a duty of care to protect my family whilst I work away, my wife has been subjected to aggressive, threatening and abusive behaviour from the next door neighbour over a prolonged period of time. The neighbour and her entourage of friends and family allow their children to play football on my path and use my garage doors as goalposts; they have caused damage to my vehicle and visiting friends vehicles by throwing stones and riding bicycles on my drive. When confronted they hurl a barrage of abuse and spit on my door, all this happens whilst I am away at work and cannot influence the situation positively. The landlord has been informed of the decaying situation however as they live in Australia they have not been much influence. As a result the police have been called on a number of occasions and have advised that we install CCTV and erect a fence within our boundaries and not to encroach on the border area. As such I am now submitting a planning application to erect a boundary fence.",On-line,Mr Joseph Christian-Madden,,,,,,,,,
