The neighbour and her entourage of friends and family allow their children to play football on my path and use my garage doors as goalposts; they have caused damage to my vehicle and visiting friends vehicles by throwing stones and riding bicycles on my drive. When confronted they hurl a barrage of abuse and spit on my door, all this happens whilst I am away at work and cannot influence the situation positively. The landlord has been informed of the decaying situation however as they live in Australia they have not been much influence. As a result the police have been called on a number of occasions and have advised that we install CCTV and erect a fence within our boundaries and not to encroach on the border area.

However, having removed the old (and note: not original, but poorly assembled) stack, the roofers established that it was not possible to build a replacement stack (the approximate measurements of which are listed below*), because there was not the sufficient underlying support for such a structure. Previous owners of the property had removed the chimney breast from ground level upwards; what's more, there was not enough basic support at loft level either. For this reason, the roofers decided to cover the relevant area of the roof with slate, in keeping with the rest of the roof. Therefore, I am submitting a planning application to retain the roof line without the chimney, as an alternative to approved planning application 16H/2214. Among the various supporting documents for this application are: a letter of explanation from Chestnut Roofers Ltd; my correspondence with planning enforcement officer Helen Brennan; and a short film showing the roof as it is now as well as the interior of 4 Mount Street (to make clear there is no chimney breast). The film footage shows the ceiling above which the chimney stack was positioned (the stains and cracks caused by the persistent leaking should be visible) as well as the wall of the same bedroom and that of the living room directly below - the shape of which should attest to the fact there is no chimney breast. In the film, my house is the one to the right, with two upstairs windows (which are slightly ajar); the chimney stack covered an area to the left of the left-sided upstairs window. The exact position, should this be required, is clarified by the accompanying architect's drawing. *Height of chimney stack: 36 inches Length across of chimney stack: 40 inches Breadth or sideways width of chimney stack: 31 inches",On-line,Mr Patrick Hart,,,,,,,,,

The specific woodland area runs from the front of Springfield Park near the entrance to the Liverpool Loopline Cycle Path to the back of the existing area of park. The path will run parallel to the Liverpool Loopline cycle path. The path is designed to be accessible to all members of the community including wheelchair and pram users in addition to those with visual impairments. The design will be informed by DDA requirements. The path will be approximately 205 metres in length including a split path and turning areas. The path is designed to enable and encourage access to Springfield Park woodland area allowing more people to experience and learn more about the natural environment in a comfortable way. The development of the woodland area will also include small clearances for Forest School areas, which will be used to deliver Forest School sessions with local schools and some fixed seating enabling the public to pause, rest and enjoy the natural environment. An edible planting trail will be planted including native species and a permanent interpretation trail incorporating interactive technology and art will be installed. The trail will provide accessible information to the public about the species throughout the woodland offering an engaging learning experience as they walk. Additional artworks will be installed to offer an enhanced multisensory experience to foster learning and engagement with the natural environment. The woodland walk development will be delivered in partnership with Lancashire Wildlife Trust; a registered charity dedicated to protecting wildlife and natural habitats throughout Lancashire, Manchester and North Merseyside. Due respect will be given to root protection areas and the plant species within the woodland with careful and appropriate woodland management carried out in order to conserve the environment. The development of a new path will provide an attractive new destination feature for people travelling on the Loopline to stop and enjoy. The plan is the first element of the masterplan to provide a new and improved Springfield Park for the local and wider community.",On-line,Ms Naylor,,,,,,,,,
