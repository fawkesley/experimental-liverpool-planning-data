# Liverpool Planning Data

This is an unofficial, community-maintained open data set.

This repository mirrors the data in Liverpool City council's [planning
explorer](http://northgate.liverpool.gov.uk/PlanningExplorer17/) website.

The aim is to provide the data in a convenient format for integrating
into other projects. As an example, see the Australian [Planning
Alerts](https://www.planningalerts.org.au/) project.

## Format of application numbers (AKA references)

The letters in front of planning applications reflect the type of application. As such, the relevant letters mean:-

- `H` – Householder apps
- `F` – Full planning apps
- `L` – Listed Building apps
- `LP` – Certificate of Lawfulness apps
- `T` – Treework apps
- `PT` – Telecoms prior approval apps
- `PM` – Demolition prior approval apps
- `NM` – Non-material apps
- `RM` – Reserved Matters apps
- `O` – Outline apps

The `PL/INV` reference relates to invalid planning applications (all apps get this reference when originally submitted until they are validated whereby they would get one of the above reference letters).
