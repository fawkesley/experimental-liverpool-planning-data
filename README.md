# Liverpool Planning Data

This repository mirrors the data in Liverpool City council's [planning
explorer](http://northgate.liverpool.gov.uk/PlanningExplorer17/) website.

The aim is to provide the data in a convenient open data format for building
into other projects. As an example, see Australian [Planning
Alerts](https://www.planningalerts.org.au/) project.

## Format of application numbers (AKA references)

The letters in front of planning applications reflect the type of application. As such, the relevant letters mean:-

- `A` – Advert
- `DIS` – Discharge of Condition
- `F` – Full planning
- `H` – Householder
- `HH` – High Hedges
- `HZ` – Hazardous Substances consent
- `L` – Listed Building
- `LE` – Certificate of Existing Lawfulness
- `LP` – Certificate of Lawfulness
- `NM` – Non-material
- `O` – Outline
- `PC` – Retail to café/restaurant
- `PD` – Storage/Distribution to residential
- `PH` – Prior approval Householder
- `PM` – Demolition prior approval
- `PO` – Prior approval use of office as residential
- `PP` – Phone Box
- `PR` – Retail to residential
- `PT` – Telecoms prior approval
- `PW` – Local Private Ways
- `RM` – Reserved Matters
- `T` – Treework
- `TC` – Trees in Conservation Areas

The `PL/INV` reference relates to invalid planning applications (all apps get this reference when originally submitted until they are validated whereby they would get one of the above reference letters).
