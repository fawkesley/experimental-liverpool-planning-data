# Liverpool Planning Data

This repository mirrors the data in Liverpool City council's [planning
explorer](http://northgate.liverpool.gov.uk/PlanningExplorer17/) website.

The aim is to provide the data in a convenient open data format for building
into other projects. As an example, see Australian [Planning
Alerts](https://www.planningalerts.org.au/) project.
